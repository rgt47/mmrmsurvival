  abstract = {Randomized, placebo-controlled trials often use time-to-event as the primary endpoint, even when a continuous measure of disease severity is available. We compare the power to detect a treatment effect using either rate of change, as estimated by linear models of longitudinal continuous data, or time-to-event estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. We propose an analytic inflation factor for comparing the two types of analyses assuming that the time-to-event can be expressed as a time-to-threshold of the continuous measure. We conduct simulations based on a publicly available Alzheimer's disease data set in which the time-to-event is algorithmically defined based on a battery of assessments. A Cox proportional hazards model of the time-to-event endpoint is compared to a linear model of a single assessment from the battery. The simulations also explore the impact of baseline covariates in either analysis.},
